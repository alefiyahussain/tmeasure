\subsection*{Abstract}

Researchers rely on networking testbeds, such as Emulab, 
 to evaluate their systems. 
Yet, they spend very little time understanding the 
 network-level characteristics of the testbed environment 
 which will strongly influence their results. 
In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of 
 the network level characteristics of four 
 Emulab-based testbeds.
We study the delay, jitter, packet loss, and bandwidth characteristics 
of the testbed network when using unicast and multicast routing. 
We discuss the implications our finding and the 
  impact  they will have on evaluations conducted 
  on the testbed.
