\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:intro} 

%what are you trying to do and why it is important 
Networking testbeds are prevalent 
and researchers use them all the time 
to evaluate their technologies 
But, evaluation are influenced by the underlying software and hardware environment

% what is current state of art 
Currently, there are no tools that enable characterizing the testbed 
 enviroments 
 hence influence of the underlying environment and how it imacpts the 
 results is never accounted for 
 
% what is the problem 
This is especially important when 
 using applications based on multicast and 
 federation technolgoies 
 We show that different evironments can influence the results in 
 different ways. 
 loss is different based on packet size 
 loss is different based on CPU type 
 loss is different in different testbeds 
The different in network assumptions, 
impact the mechanisms that are needed in the end application.  

% our approach 
In this paper we first discus applications that 
may be especially sensitive to such variance in software/hardware environments 
In the methods section, we present out method 
In the reustl section we present out results

Our contributions are: 
 a characterization for testbed environments 
 we consider two testbeds 
   characterize based on traffic mix, 
   characterize based on unicast 
   based on multicast, and federation links.
